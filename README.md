# Analysis for the book west meets east

This is the code to analyse data from the [NOAA NCEI](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/) for the book east meets west:

Daily Precipitation data is downloaded in [`Download data.ipynb`](https://github.com/Daafip/west-meets-east/blob/main/Download%20data.ipynb) from [www.ncei.noaa.gov](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/cmorph-high-resolution-global-precipitation-estimates/). This takes quite some time and downloads all the specified years: in this case 1998-2022. Note a seperate path might be required with little to no spacing: _just how wget works `-\_(ãƒ„)_/- ` _
